# Cookie Management System

A privacy-focused cookie management system built using **C++ and Qt Widgets**. This tool enables users to read, analyze, filter, and anonymize cookies, helping raise awareness about third-party tracking and promoting user data protection — with a strong focus on usability and visual feedback.

> 🛠 Developed as part of my final year university project in Cyber Security.
